                  <p>2020 presented a unique challenge for medical personnel and patients everywhere. As a nurse, founder Casey David saw this firsthand. She and many of her colleagues could no longer see their usual patients in person, but Casey believed that they should still be able to get the proper care. So, as the country shut down, she collaborated with a skilled team in order to create a company that could provide a seamless transition from in-person medical care to telehealth. The result was Med-Dia, a service that combines technical know-how and services with a wealth of medical knowledge. </p>

                Purpose</h3>
            <p>One of the most crucial questions when the pandemic first started and hospitals filled up was how could patients be treated in a way that didnâ€™t require healthcare professionals to see them in person? What is the best way to help save or improve lives without putting possibly already vulnerable people at more risk? As a solution to this, we created a website design that could address the problem and help people with both scheduling appointments and meeting with providers. Using a combination of technology and the latest medical updates, the online medical industry has a chance to change the world for the better. Online access would mean everybody has a chance to get the help they need, without wait times or exposure to viruses and other dangers. Everybody should have a chance to receive medical care, especially during such a stressful time. Telehealth was once something that many people had never even considered, but now it has been launched into prevalence for good reason. We are committed to ease of use, access, and a concept that has potential to help people.
